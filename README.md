# Opti P2 C++
Inspired by MS-DOS - 
(Go here for the original Opti P2, made in Python. It's full of features, even more than this version! - https://github.com/FamousMaslina/Opti-P2)

## Why?
* This is a way to gain experience with C++ for school, and test my skills a little with other languages. 

## Instructions:
### For Windows:
* After downloading 'op2.exe' from either cloning the repo or downloading it straight from the 'Releases' tab, make sure to have installed:
    * Visual c++ Redistributable
    * .NET Framework 4.8.1 AND .NET Framework 3.0 enabled in "Windows Features" window.
* Then, you can go right ahead and run 'op2.exe' directly and execute 'help' to see a list of commands.
* If you want custom hardware, you can run 'op2clauncher.exe'.

### For Linux:
* (Linux Support & Tutorial coming in 0.2)
