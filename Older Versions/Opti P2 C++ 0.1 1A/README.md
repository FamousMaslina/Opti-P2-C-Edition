# Opti P2 C++ - Spinoff that was made in Python
Inspired by MS-DOS

## Why?
* This is a way to gain experience with C++ for school, and test my skills a little with other languages. 

## Instructions:
### For Windows:
* After downloading 'op2.exe' from either cloning the repo or downloading it straight from the 'Releases' tab, make sure to have installed:
    * Visual c++ Redistributable
    * .NET Framework 4.8.1 AND .NET Framework 3.0 enabled in "Windows Features" window.
* Then, you can go right ahead and run 'op2.exe' directly and execute 'help' to see a list of commands.
(Linux Support & Tutorial coming in 0.2)

## Update log:
### ----0.1 (Master Version) 1A----
* Added 'help', 'info' and 'cls' commands.
